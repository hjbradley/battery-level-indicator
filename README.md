# Battery Level Indicator

In this example, we create a battery level indicator using HTML and CSS. We then use the `navigator.getBattery()` method to get the current battery level and listen for changes in the battery level. Finally, we update the battery level indicator by setting the width of the battery-level element to a percentage of the battery level. The result is a simple battery level indicator that updates in real-time as the battery level changes. Note that this example may not work on all browsers, as the `navigator.getBattery()` method is not yet widely supported.
